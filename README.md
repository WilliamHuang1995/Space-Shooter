# Space-Shooter

<b>My second Unity game.</b>  

This is created by following the video instructions from the unity website.
The link can be found here: https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/space-shooter-tutorial

The whole project took about 2 days in total to complete. 
I also did the extension part for this tutorial as I didn't like the fact that only  
the player is only met by falling asteroids. So I added enemy spaceships to make it  
slightly harder.
I'm still figuring out what else to add for a README as I am still fairly new to using  
Github. Any comments and suggestions are welcome. 

The link to the actual game can be downloaded from my Dropbox here:

Again, feel free to give me feedback!
